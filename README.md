# DiscordNativeTitlebarSize
A css to be used with https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord that makes the title bar feel like Windows 10
## Discord finally "fixed" it
As of stable 381866 (e26d54e) Discord has finally decided to make the title bar the native size (well, it kind of depends on your UI spacing setting ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) & fix the grab area for moving the window, therefore i'll archive this repo.

I made a new repo to fix some design flaws like the terribly misaligned message box here: [inxomnyaaDiscordPatches](https://github.com/inxomnyaa/inxomnyaaDiscordPatches/tree/master)
